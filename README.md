# Price sale for housing regressor

The **objective** of this project is to create an accurate sale price calculation tool for a Real State company, developing in the process a full Data Science Project

## Overview
### - Exploratory Data Analysis of housing data (Insights):

- Missing values handling
- All numerical variables
- Distribution of numerical variables
- Categorical variables
- Cardinatily of categorical variables
- Outliers
- Relationships between dependent and independent features


### - Feature engineering framework

- Splitting data into train and test set with stratified sampling tecnique to preserve distributions found in the housing data
- Creation of an advanced custom transformation pipeline with helpfull tools such as: median imputer, log normalization, custom column modifiers, rare category handler, NaN dropper, categoric variable encoder and variables scaler. (to clean and transform in a fast way future raw sets)

Note: I could have used ScikitLearn tools such as imputer or Ordinal Encoder, however to add more value to the project and have more control I defined my own cleaning functions

### - Feature selection framework
### - Model selection, training and tunning
### - Results summary
